 An if statement is used to show if the answer is true or flase. The command we use for this is:
 
 ```csharp
    if (a > b)  

 ```
 If we want something tpo happen if the condition is true, we write it in {} like this:
 
 ```csharp
 
 {
     Console.WriteLine("A is the biggest");
 }
 

 ```
We can add something for the computer to do if the condition is false by using the command else:

 ```csharp
   else
 {
    Console.WriteLine("B is the biggest");
 }

  Console.ReadLine();


 ```
