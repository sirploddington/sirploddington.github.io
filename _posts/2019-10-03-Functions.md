A function is like a subroutine, except it gives an answer.

Some functions include:
 
 ```csharp
 
 random
 substring
 round
 
 ```
 
 The return function returns the value calculated within the subroutine
 
 To do this we write:
 
 ```csharp
 
public static int quadruple(int x)
{
    int answer = x * 4;
    return answer;
}

 ```
