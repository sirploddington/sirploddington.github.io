 To create a subroutine, you start with the header line:
 
 ```csharp
 
 public static void greeting()
 
 ```
 
 To set the subroutine, you write:
 
 ```csharp
 
  {
       Console.WriteLine("Hello");
       Console.WriteLine("Pleased to meet you");
  }

 ```
 
 To print the subroutine, we would write the name in the header
 
 For example:
 
  ```csharp
 
greeting();

 ```
