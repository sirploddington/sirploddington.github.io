 To create a do while:
 
 ```csharp
 
 int x = 0;
            int y = 0;


            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine("in Do... While");
                x++;
            }
            while (x < 3); //Whilst x is less than 3, the command in the do will run  .     

            while (y < 3)  //Whilst y is less than 3, the command in the while will run.
            {
                Console.WriteLine("In While");
                y++;
            }

            Console.ReadLine();

 
 ```
