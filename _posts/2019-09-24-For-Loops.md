 A For loop allows us to repeat a task over and over again. 
 To create a for loop, we can do:
 
 ```csharp
 for (int a = 0; a<1000; a++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(a);
            }

Console.ReadLine();
 
 ```
 a=0  Makes an interger of a and sets it to 0.
      a<1000  Sets the loop to keep going until a no longer is less than 1000.
      a++  adds 1 to a every time the loop is run
 
 ```csharp
 
for (int a = 0; a<1000; a++)

 ```
