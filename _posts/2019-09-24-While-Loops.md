 A While loop allows us to repeat a task over and over again while a condition is true. 
 To create a While loop, we can do:
 
 ```csharp
 int x = 0;

            while (x <= 100)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(x);
                x++;
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
 
 ```
 x<=100    The condition for the loop to continue
